## Interesting Piece of Code

The interesting piece of code adding a vehicle to the inventory and removing a vehicle from the inventory by only using VIN number. The code snippet below shows how the vehicle is added to the inventory and removed from the inventory by using the VIN number.
### 1. Adding a Vehicle - `processAddVehicleRequest` Method Explanation.
 The `processAddVehicleRequest` method is designed to handle the addition of new vehicles to the dealership's inventory by interacting with the user to input the vehicle details and then updating the inventory.
### Steps Involved in the `processAddVehicleRequest` Method

1. **Prompt for Vehicle Information:**
   The method prompts the user to enter various details about the vehicle. This interactive process ensures that all the necessary data to create a new vehicle record is gathered from the user. Here are the details requested:

    - **VIN (Vehicle Identification Number):** A unique identifier for the vehicle.
    - **Year:** The production year of the vehicle.
    - **Make:** The manufacturer or brand of the vehicle (e.g., Honda, Tesla).
    - **Model:** The specific model name or number of the vehicle (e.g., Civic, Model S).
    - **Type:** The type or category of the vehicle (e.g., Sedan, SUV).
    - **Color:** The color of the vehicle.
    - **Odometer Reading:** The total mileage the vehicle has traveled.
    - **Price:** The sale price of the vehicle.

   Example prompts:

   ```java
   System.out.print("Enter VIN: ");
   int vin = scanner.nextInt();
   System.out.print("Enter year: ");
   int year = scanner.nextInt();

    ``` 
Additional prompts for make, model, type, color, odometer, and price are also included in the method. Here is the code snippet for the complete `processAddVehicleRequest` method:

### 2. Removing a Vehicle - `processRemoveVehicleRequest` Method Explanation.
The `processRemoveVehicleRequest` method is designed to handle the removal of vehicles from the dealership's inventory by interacting with the user to input the VIN number of the vehicle to be removed and then updating the inventory.
### Steps Involved in the `processRemoveVehicleRequest` Method

1. **Prompt for VIN Number:**
   The method prompts the user to enter the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) of the vehicle to be removed from the inventory. This interactive process ensures that the user provides the correct identifier for the vehicle to be removed.

   Example prompt:

   ```java
   System.out.print("Enter VIN of the vehicle to remove: ");
   int vin = scanner.nextInt();
   ```

#### The VIN number is used to uniquely identify the vehicle to be removed from the inventory. If the VIN number provided by the user matches a vehicle in the inventory, that vehicle is removed. If no matching vehicle is found, an error message is displayed to the user.
